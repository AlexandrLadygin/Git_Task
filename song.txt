When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song

When the White Wolf fought
A silver tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can't be bleat

Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, valley of plenty

At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And bring you the morn, oh
